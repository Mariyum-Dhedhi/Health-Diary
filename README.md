# Health-Diary
Developed prototype to outreach sponsors to budget a project that would help health workforce to organize their patient’s records. The disorganization faced by the health workforce in developing countries due to paperwork causes problems. 
Health Diary provides a comprehensive compilation of a patient’s medical history in one place for patients, physicians, hospitals, insurance companies, and diagnostic centers.
